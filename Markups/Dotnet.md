# What is .NET
- a free, open-source development platform for building many kinds of apps, such as:
    -Web apps
    -Web APIs
    -Microservices
    -Desktop apps
    -Games
    -Mobile app
    -Machine learning
    -Console apps
    -Windows services
    -IoT

Sharing functionality among different apps by using class libraries.

## .NET is Cross platform
    - Windows
    - macOS
    - Linux
    - Android
    - iOS
    - tvOS
    - watchOS

Supported processor architectures include:
    - x64
    - x86
    - Arm32
    - Arm64

.Net allows the use of platform-specific capabilities, such as operating system APIs.

.NET core is the latest implementation and runs on any platform.

.NET Framework is the orginal implementation of .NET and runs only on Windows.

.NET Standard is not an implementation of .NET, but rather an API specification that allows for development of class libraries for multiple implementations of .NET

## Tools and productivity

.NET supports three programming languages:
    - C#
    - F#
    - Visual Basic

Some of the capabilities that .NET languages support:
    - Type safety
    - Type inference
    - Generic types
    - Lambdas
    - Delegates
    - Events
    - Exceptions
    - Attributes
    - Asynchronous code
    - Parallel programming
    - Code analyzers

## SDK and runtimes
The .NET SDK is a set of libraries and tools for developing and running .NET applications.


## Terminology
    - Common Language Runtime (CLR)
        {The execution environment for a managed program. The OS is part of the runtime evironment but isn't part of the .NET runtime.}

    - .NET runtime 
        {The CLR and runtime libraries, which together provide support for running framework-dependent apps.}

    - Runtime Identifier (RID)
        {The OS platform and CPU architecture that a .NET app runs on.}

    - SDK
        {A collection of tools and libraries that you download and install to develop and run .NET apps. Includes the CLI, MSBuild, the .NET runtime, and other components.}
