Positioning the increment and decrement operators:


Both the increment and decrement operators have an interesting quality -- 
depending on their position, they perform their operation before or after 
they retrieve their value. In other words, if you use the operator before 
the value as in `++value`, then the increment will happen before the value 
is retrieved. 

Likewise, `value++` will increment the value after the value has been retrieved.
